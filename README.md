# hello-world
**Descrition:** This repository is to complete the requirement for the Code Class.
**This is a litle information about me**: My name is Franklin Sotolongo, and I’m a project manager who thrives on creating structure, fostering teamwork, and always looking for ways to improve. My faith, family, and community mean the world to me, and I’ve been blessed to serve in missions, mentoring, and helping others grow. When I’m not working, you’ll find me hiking, tinkering with things, or exploring new places, soaking up life’s simple joys. I enjoy connecting with people from all walks of life and finding inspiration in the little things every day.
